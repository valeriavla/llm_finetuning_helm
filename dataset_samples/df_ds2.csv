Within three days, the intertwined cup nest of grasses was complete, featuring a canopy of overhanging grasses to conceal it.

 {'content': 'Today marks a new day in not only American history but world history. We are no longer alone in the universe. Life outside our planet exists and aliens have landed in Nevada.\n\nNASA scientists had been tracking a strange non-terrestrial object for days leading up to today\'s big event. The object appeared from behind the dark side of the moon and was originally believed to be an untracked asteroid or comet. However, the object\'s path and speed started changing until today it entered Earth\'s atmosphere. Instead of burning up like a hunk of space rock, it was able to penetrate the atmosphere and survive.\n\nThe military scrambled jets and the first sighting described the flying object as being triangular with a matte black exterior and no visible ports of entry or egress. It was a tense few moments as first contact was made but the craft was allowed to continue unhindered as it showed no hostile intent.\n\nPassing over Washington, D.C., Chicago, and other major metropolitan areas the craft finally touched down in Nevada. Many top officials believed they were heading to the notorious Area 51. But that proved not to be the case as the UFO instead landed directly on the Vegas strip. Roughly the size of a 747 jet, all traffic stopped immediately.\n\nTwo figures exited the craft distinctly humanoid in shape. The taller of the two raised its right hand and made a gesture splitting their fingers into a V-shape and spoke in perfect English, ""Live long and prosper."" It was at this point that the shorter alien slapped the taller alien on the shoulder and let out an audible sigh.\n\nThey were Trekkies. The aliens were Star Trek fans.\n\nAs people approached the aliens they noticed they were clad in the uniforms of the original Star Trek officers, one in yellow for command and one in blue for science specialty. This was no alien invasion, this was a vacation.\n\nThe aliens were allowed to proceed as journalists and military personnel alike shadowed them. They went directly to the casino already possessing American dollars and proceeded to lose it all at the dice table in less than an hour. Following this display, they went to the buffet and ate three plates of crab legs. These visitors to Vegas were not too different from us. We are not alone.', 'role': 'assistant'}]",Generation

"Write a letter to the Editor responding to the news article, as if you are a dog. Thank the editor for highlighting this important topic. Rewrite all the main facts in the article.

A vet has warned pet owners to be very careful when using oil diffusers in their homes, as certain oils can prove fatal for dogs.
This comes after a grandmother shared how her beloved pooch was poisoned by the oils in her diffuser, and was left unable to recognise her when she returned from working a late shift as a nanny.
Sharing her warning on Facebook, Marrianne Whyte explained that she'd initially assumed she'd woken her dog up from a dream, in which he had been experiencing night terrors, but found he was ""still acting weird"" the next day.
After turning off her new diffuser, Marrianne noticed that her pet's condition started to improve, but didn't make the connection straight away. Marrianne set off for another shift, but ended up returning home early after receiving a worrying call from her dog sitter.
In her post, which has been shared more than 1.5 million times, Marrianne, who lives in New Zealand, wrote: ""[She] said that he wouldn't come out from under the bed. It was very odd as he is a happy dog.
""I came from work early and again, he was very confused about who I was. So I took him to an emergency vet. It turns out that the tea tree oil I was using in the diffuser is toxic for dogs.""

Thankfully, tests confirmed that Marriane's dog hadn't suffered liver damage, but they ""weren't out of the woods yet"", and the vet gave him fluids under his skin to get rid of any toxins.
Vet clinic Pets on Parker told 7life that cats are also at risk of being poisoned by essential oils because they don't have a liver enzyme called glucuronyl transferase, which is required to break them down.
The experts explained: ""Their livers are slower at eliminating these compounds, which can lead to toxic build-up. While dogs do not lack this enzyme, they are still sensitive to essential oils and can become very sick if exposed to them.

""Common signs of poisoning as a result of inhalation (usually from an oil diffuser) include laboured breathing, lack of coordination and difficulty walking, drooling, diarrhoea, lethargy, depression, low body temperature, weakness, muscle tremors, and vomiting.""",e9da2fa3a6d496c5a5ee500e58e5477362698aaa08e74ceeffd3fa89d0f806cb,"[{'content': 'Write a letter to the Editor responding to the news article, as if you are a dog.

 {'content': 'Dear Editor,\n\nMany thanks for raising this important issue in your paper. Dog owners must be very careful when using oil diffusers in their homes, particularly ones containing tea tree oil. Tea tree oil can be lethal for dogs.\n\nA New Zealand grandmother shared a heartbreaking story about how her beloved pooch was poisoned by the oils in her diffuser. The poor dog was left unable to recognise her when she returned from working a late shift as a nanny. It is great that Marrianne Whyte shared her warning on Facebook because it raises awareness of this issue. In fact, her post has been shared 1.5 million times.\n\nWhen she tried to wake her dog up, she thought the dog had been having a dream, or been experiencing night terrors. However, she found that he was ""still acting weird"" the next day. The following day Marrianne set off for another shift but had to return home early after receiving a worrying call from her dog sitter because the dog wouldn\'t come out from under the bed. It was very out of character because he was a happy dog. After returning early from work Marrianne Whyte found the dog in a confused state, so she took him to the emergency vet. \n\nIt was then she discovered that the tea tree oil in her diffuser is toxic for dogs. There is a happy ending to the story, because fortunately, tests confirmed that Marriane\'s dog hadn\'t suffered liver damage. However, the vet gave him fluids under his skin to get rid of any toxins. Cat lovers should also be aware, as Vet Clinic Pets on Parker, so rightly points out. Cats are also at risk of being poisoned by essential oils. Cats don\'t have a liver enzyme called glucuronyl transferase, which is required to break them down. Cats\' livers are slower at eliminating these compounds, which can lead to toxic build-up. \n\nDogs, like me, do not lack this enzyme, but we are still sensitive to essential oils and we are liable to become very sick if exposed to them. Owners can look out for common signs of poisoning as a result of inhalation from an oil diffuser, by watching for laboured breathing, lack of coordination and difficulty walking, drooling, diarrhoea, lethargy, depression, low body temperature, weakness, muscle tremors and vomiting.\n\nTherefore, you see the terrible effects that these diffusers can have on animals like me. I thank you for highlighting and raising awareness of this problem. I hope that no other dog will have to suffer as a result of tea tree oil diffusers.\n\nRegards,\nRolo the dog', 'role': 'assistant'}]",Rewrite

She wasn't wearing shoes or socks, and when she stepped, one could see the black caked on the soles of her feet. Surprisingly, she didn't wear heavy makeup. It was light and natural, with mascara, a light blush around her cheeks, and subtle lip stain being the only adornments. \n\nThese, of course, were not her most notable features.

 {'content': ""If you're looking for information on how to care for a guinea pig, you've come to the right place! Guinea pigs are animals that are best in bonded pairs or groups. You should never adopt only one guinea pig as they are social creatures. Guinea pigs need to eat hay (timothy, oat, or wheatgrass) every day as their teeth are constantly growing and need to be ground down as they chew. They should also have nutritional pellets daily and a mixture of vegetables. Never feed your guinea pig iceberg lettuce, though, as it's too watery! When your guinea pig learns its feeding pattern, you'll notice a high-pitched 'wheek!' sound coming from their cage as soon as the fridge opens or they hear the rustle of a plastic bag! Supplement your feedings with occasional Vitamin C drops, also. Take your guinea pigs out once a day for free roam or floor time so that they can stretch their legs and play. Cages should be at minimum 2 feet by 3 feet for a single guinea pig - but more is always better if you've got the space. Boars need to have boar cleanings once a month where you'll clean out their inside sac of all the hay, food, and bedding particles that accumulate in there. Speaking of bedding - many owners recommend using fabric cage liners for guinea pigs as it's soft on their feet, easy to clean, and good for the environment. These include a top and bottom layer of fleece with an absorbing pad in the middle. You'll just wipe up quick messes of pee or poop on top, then throw the liners in the washing machine once a week. If you can't do liners, soft untreated paper bedding is best. "", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Generation
