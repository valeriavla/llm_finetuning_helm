Interesting. I'll be curious to see how this works out. I often refrain from commenting because I don't have the time or desire to engage with the couple of resident trolls who seem to jump on every active WW comment thread.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"I'm glad you're working on this, and I look forward to seeing how it plays out.    The comments sections of online news stories have the potential to be great tools for community interaction about current events, a Neo Town Hall, of sorts.  One of the reasons I rely on Reddit as a platform for news and local discussions is that there's a sense of community interaction that's often lacking in my ""real life,"" hectic discussions.  

But hopefully we won't be tempted to silence those who take unpopular stances.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Nice to some attempts to try to make comments better—it feels like any innovation in commenting communities ended with the launch of Disqus nearly a decade ago.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"One would hope that the purpose of introducing this system is to encourage more debate and discussion, not less.  It seems there are several things that limit the flow of discussion:  Making comments that are personal attacks or encouraging witch hunts; true spam (which has been a real problem on WW's comment section, in my experience); and chasing rabbits to draw discussions away from the primary subject at hand.

I, for one, don't want to see unpopular opinions silenced.  Healthy debate is an important component of a civil society.  But when discussions degenerate into insults and distraction, it actually limits the ability of people to talk with each other.  I'm believing that this is the intention of your newspaper here, and I hope it's a movement that results in more, not less, commentary on current events.  We need it.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"I agree! Comments have so much potential to be places for active discussion, especially in publications that already serve an amazing community (but then, I'm biased—I'm a Civil co-founder). We've worked hard to make sure that the comments section won't become an echo chamber, though, by combining clever algorithms on the backend with the peer reviews. That's also why there are two separate questions: ""is this a *good* comment?"" and ""is this comment civil?""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"Great question! It's one we're asked a lot. We've designed the system assuming that people *will* try to abuse it. So, in addition to the peer reviews, there are algorithms on the backend doing a lot of meta-analysis. I'm sure the system isn't 100% perfect yet, but we know from months of beta testing that it's a really solid start, and we'll keep working to improve it!",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"Our aim is actually the opposite: we want spirited debate in which everyone feels free to participate, without fear of harassment, abuse, or death threats. Right now, a lot of voices are being silenced due to that fear. We designed Civil Comments for civil, respectful discussion and debate—we don't want it to become a ""positive comments only"" echo chamber. There's a lot going on on the backend to prevent abuse of the system. So, everyone is free to speak their mind, even if their opinion is unpopular—so long as they treat each other with respect.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
