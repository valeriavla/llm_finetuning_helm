What are the three most important things to consider when deciding what technology to use to build an assist device to help an elderly person with basic needs?,"To build an assistive device to help an elderly person with basic needs, one must consider three crucial things: safety, compatibility, and ease of use. Safety is paramount, as the device must not cause harm to the user. Compatibility with the user's environment and other devices is also essential. Finally, the device must be simple enough for the elderly person to operate.",3,4,4,2,2
What are the three most important things to consider when deciding what technology to use to build an assist device to help an elderly person with basic needs?,"There are many different types of assistive devices that can be used to help an elderly person with their basic needs. When deciding what technology to use to build an assistive device, it is important to consider the following three factors:

1. The needs of the elderly person: The first and most important factor to consider is the specific needs of the elderly person who will be using the assistive device. It is important to understand their physical limitations, as well as their daily routine and activities, in order to design an assistive device that will be effective and useful for them.

2. The capabilities of the technology: It is also important to consider the capabilities of the technology that will be used to build the assistive device. For example, if the elderly person has limited vision, it may be important to use a technology that provides auditory feedback or haptic feedback in addition to visual feedback.

3. The ease of use of the technology: Finally, it is important to consider the ease of use of the technology. The assistive device should be designed in a way that is easy for the elderly person to understand and use, even if they have limited dexterity or cognitive abilities. This may involve using simple controls, providing clear instructions, or using a natural language interface.

By considering these three factors, it is possible to build an assistive device that is effective, useful, and easy to use for the elderly person.",4,3,3,2,3

2. The ease of use: The assist device should be easy to use and understand, with clear and simple instructions. The elderly person should be able to operate the device without assistance.

3. The reliability of the technology: The assist device should be reliable and robust, with minimal risk of malfunction or failure. The technology should be tested thoroughly to ensure it is safe and effective.",4,4,4,2,2

The three most important things to consider when deciding what technology to use are:

1. Safety: The technology should be safe for the elderly person to use and should not cause any harm or injury.

2. Ease of use: The technology should be easy to understand and use, with clear and concise instructions.

3. Compatibility: The technology should be compatible with the elderly person's needs and abilities, and should be able to accommodate any special requirements or limitations.

It is also important to consider the person's specific needs when choosing a technology, such as their level of mobility, cognitive abilities, and sensory capabilities. Additionally, you should consider the cost of the technology, the availability of support and maintenance, and the potential for the technology to improve the person's quality of life.

Family doctors and general practice doctors have similar educational and residency requirements, and offer some of the same medical services. Each completes a four-year bachelor’s degree with a strong emphasis in chemistry, biology and physics; four years of education at an accredited U.S. medical school; and three years of residency under the supervision of a senior physician educator. Differences in their approaches relate to specialization and types of care.

Practice Philosophy
Family practice physicians focus on meeting the needs of the entire family. The family doctor is uniquely trained to care for the whole person throughout his or her life, from birth to old age. Family doctors often receive training outside of general medicine in the areas of pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, and geriatrics. General practice doctors also see patients of any age, but do not typically specialize in a particular area. General practice doctors use their skills and expertise to treat medical conditions and identify areas that need continued care from a specialist.

Types of Patients
The general practitioner sees patients of all ages, and serves as an individual's primary-care provider and access point to specialists and specialized testing. The general practice doctor provides well visits for children and adults, sick visits for the treatment of acute conditions, and introductory care for diseases such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Family practice physicians also see patients of all ages, but because they specialize, patients may receive more of their medical care in this one location instead of being referred to specialists.

Preventative Medicine vs. Treatment
Because family practice doctors work with patients throughout their lifetime, the primary focus is on preventative medicine. Family physicians work with families to promote their overall physical and mental well-being. They also provide education for disease prevention and treatment of illnesses, and manage chronic medical conditions. General practice doctors focus on the treatment of acute conditions and build relationships with trusted specialists to provide appropriate care for those with complex medical conditions.

Certification and Continuing Education
Family physicians are certified by the American Board of Family Medicine, which requires re-certification every six years by examination. Family physicians must also complete a minimum of 150 hours of continuing education every three years. General practice physicians are certified by the American Board of General Practice through one of two methods. The Primary Standard Pathway requires the completion of the General Practice Training Program of the American College of General Medicine. The Previous Experience Pathway allows for immediate certification by the board through oral examination.

It's a job that I love, and I'm sure you'll love it too!

As a family doctor, I have to be ready for anything. I see patients of all ages, from babies to grandparents, and I have to be able to treat them all. That means I have to know a lot about medicine, so I have to study really hard. But it's worth it, because I get to help people feel better and stay healthy.

One of the best things about being a family doctor is that I get to know my patients really well. I see them through all the big moments in their lives, like when they have a baby or when they get sick. And because I know them so well, I can help them make the best decisions for their health.

Being a family doctor isn't always easy, but it's always rewarding. I have to make tough decisions sometimes, and I have to be there for my patients when they need me the most. But at the end of the day, I know that I'm making a difference in people's lives.

So if you're thinking about becoming a family doctor, I say go for it! It's a job that's full of surprises, but it's also full of love and joy. And that's what really matters.",3,3,3,2,1

Or does he send news? Has he found the Almeida Killer?""

More confused at the changes in the once well-groomed man she'd seen a few months ago than by his gibberish about Almeida, she pitched her head side to side. ""I'm not sure if his note has more news of a two-year old bloodbath that savaged my Spanish lands. But, I know he wants you to return with me.""

""No! Hart will not order me around. Nor will one of his foot soldiers.""

His voice felt like thunder. His shaking fist would surely hit with a punch of lightning, still she held the note out to him.

""I swore to him I'd kill the next messenger who came to me."" Bannerman flexed his gloved fingers. ""I guess you're the lucky one he chose to die.""

Death didn't scare Isadel any more than living with regrets. She folded her arms about her. ""I've always been lucky like that.""

""I'll give it to Hartland. He knew how much the former me liked a good joke. But a dead man has no room for laughter or more guilt. Return to Hart and tell him no.""

She stamped her foot like a girl, but hardened her voice. ""Do your worst, or return with me to Hartland Abbey. No middle ground.""

He came near. She could smell the stench of metal coming from his arm or his hand—so like her father's apothecary shop. His arms flexed as he hovered. He was large, larger than she remembered, but as a good servant, she'd never been this near to him.

His scent, ferrous or sulfur, strangled. ""No one gives me ultimatums.""

If this was the end, part of her was glad of it. Straightening her spine, she held her breath and waited to be throttled, waited for darkness to overcome her when he choked the air from her throat betwixt his large hands. That had to be a better fate than going to prison or living with the knowledge she'd failed at her one chance to kill her enemy.

~~~

Hugh Bannerman raised his hands ready to punch the messenger through the wall as he'd done with everyone else who'd stood against him, but the boy merely did the task Hart had requested, just as Phipps, his man-of-all-work would do. Hugh took a breath and lowered his fists. He turned and let his frustration meet the desk. When he tapped it, the legs split and sent his piles of research spilling to the floor.

He flexed his palm, but the rapid action hadn't caused his hand to bleed again.

Hugh took the note and began reading. His face turned red, and he threw the paper on the floor. ""Don't give me that smirk. You're going to prison.""

Isadel sighed. ""Please, Hart wants me to return with you. You know how much he misses me.""

Hugh shook his head. ""No, I'm not going to let you go back to Hartland Abbey. You're going to prison for your crimes.""

Isadel rolled her eyes. ""Fine, whatever. I'll just go to prison then."" She walked away, but turned back to add, ""But you're still going to prison too.""",2,2,2,2,2
What are the origins of ice cream? How did it evolve from a rare and expensive delicacy to the ubiquitous treat that it is today?,"The origins of ice cream can be traced back to China, where frozen treats were enjoyed as early as the 10th century. Ice cream was also popular in ancient Rome, where it was enjoyed by the wealthy. The recipe for ice cream as we know it today, however, is thought to have originated in Italy during the Renaissance. The recipe was brought to the United States by Italian immigrants in the 19th century, and ice cream quickly became a popular treat.",2,3,4,2,1
What are the origins of ice cream? How did it evolve from a rare and expensive delicacy to the ubiquitous treat that it is today?,"The origins of ice cream can be traced back to ancient China, where a frozen dessert similar to ice cream was first created. The recipe for this ancient ice cream included rice, milk, and fruit. Over time, the recipe evolved and spread to other parts of the world, including Europe. In the 16th century, the Italian chef of Catherine de Medici, the wife of King Henry II of France, created a recipe for a frozen dessert that included eggs, sugar, and cream. This recipe became known as ""royale"" and was considered a rare and expensive delicacy.

The popularity of ice cream continued to grow throughout the centuries, and by the 19th century, it had become a popular treat in the United States. The invention of the ice cream maker in the mid-19th century made it easier to produce large quantities of ice cream, and the invention of the ice cream cone in the late 19th century made it easier to eat ice cream on the go.

Today, ice cream is a ubiquitous treat that is enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. It is now available in a wide variety of flavors and is often made with healthier ingredients such as fruits, nuts, and other natural sweeteners. Ice cream has also become a popular ingredient in many desserts, such as ice cream sandwiches, ice cream cakes, and ice cream pies.",4,3,4,2,3
What are the origins of ice cream? How did it evolve from a rare and expensive delicacy to the ubiquitous treat that it is today?,"Ice cream has a long and storied history, dating back to ancient China where it is believed that the earliest forms of the frozen treat were created. The earliest written records of ice cream come from the courts of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century, where it was served as a rare and expensive delicacy for the nobility. It wasn't until the 19th century that ice cream began to become more widely available and accessible, as the invention of the ice cream cone and the ice cream scoop made it easier to serve and consume. The invention of the home freezer in the 1920s further democratized ice cream, making it possible for families to enjoy the treat at home. Today, ice cream is a global phenomenon, with countless flavors and varieties available in stores and restaurants around the world.",2,3,3,2,1

This early version of ice cream was brought to Europe by Marco Polo during his travels to China in the 13th century, where it quickly became a luxury item reserved for the wealthy. In the 17th century, ice cream began to be produced commercially in Italy, and by the 18th century, it had become a popular delicacy in France and England.

The modern-day ice cream we know and love today began to emerge in the late 19th century, with the invention of the mechanical ice cream maker. This invention made it possible to produce ice cream on a large scale, and ice cream shops began to pop up all over the United States. During the 20th century, ice cream became even more accessible, with the invention of the popsicle and the ice cream truck.

You don't do well with idle time and feel uncomfortable being social unless there is some purpose to the interaction. In spite of this you cherish tradition and will enjoy the holidays on a deeper level when traditions, history and roots are being honored.

Capricorn, we know you are not cold and detached. Your sense of business and work ethic help give order and structure to your life and are as natural as eating or sleeping. You may not be into the warm fuzzies of holiday sentimentality but you provide an important foundation of stability, discipline, order and structure so that others can enjoy reveling in the holiday cheer.

You do have a warm heart and good sense of humor, its just that you feel more at ease when there is some kind of work to be done.

That being said, you don't have to isolate yourself from the festivities in order to feel connected with your sense of purpose. Your ""job"" may be playing Santa, cleaning the house, organizing a food drive, shoveling sidewalks, or organizing the holiday greeting card list.

Capricorn Healthy Diet

You have a good sense of self discipline and will not likely overindulge once you have made up your mind not to. You could easily stick to the same meals all the time and not get bored, for you are truly a creature of habit. Therefore if you are in the midst of making dietary changes to support your health or weight loss, it can be challenging to adapt to food substitutions (what do you mean no meat, potatoes and butter?!)

When it comes to diet you are turned off by trends. You want to see the proof in the pudding, so to speak, about why a certain meal plan or diet is recommended. You approach life like the CEO of a business. If results can be proven by the test of time, you will invest your money, energy and time in creating the same results in your own life.

However you are not fooled by hype over the latest health food and you know that green wrapping is not synonymous with healthy.

Yours is the energy of Karma and timing, Capricorn. You want to see the before and after picture and you need to know that you will get results, although you are patient and don't expect instant gratification from a diet.

You can withstand peer pressure in the realm of food and most other things but you are a traditionalist and it is difficult for you to break habits and change your routines. Try gradual shifts rather than radical changes.

If you are raised on 3 meals a day, at certain times, these practices will be closely tied to your sense of order, control and correct action.

You may not be into the warm fuzzies of holiday sentimentality but you provide an important foundation of stability, discipline, order and structure so that others can enjoy reveling in the holiday cheer.

You do have a warm heart and good sense of humor, its just that you feel more at ease when there is some kind of work to be done.

That being said, you don't have to isolate yourself from the festivities in order to feel connected with your sense of purpose. Your ""job"" may be playing Santa, cleaning the house, organizing a food drive, shoveling sidewalks, or organizing the holiday greeting card list. Find ways to bring the value of structure and security into the festivities rather than secluding yourself from the celebrations to only focus on work.",4,3,4,2,3
"What is the ozone layer, and how does it protect us from harmful radiation from the sun?","The ozone layer is a layer of ozone gas in the stratosphere, about 15–30 km (9.3–18.6 miles) above the surface of the Earth. The ozone layer is important because it filters out most of the harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun.

Ozone gas (O3) is a naturally occurring molecule that is made up of three oxygen atoms. When ozone molecules are exposed to ultraviolet radiation, they break down into ordinary oxygen molecules (O2). This process helps to protect living things on Earth from the harmful effects of UV radiation, such as skin cancer and damage to crops and other plants.

The ozone layer is vulnerable to damage from certain types of pollutants, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting substances. When these pollutants are released into the atmosphere, they can rise into the stratosphere and break down ozone molecules, causing the ozone layer to thin. This process can increase the amount of harmful UV radiation that reaches the Earth's surface, which can have negative effects on human health and the environment.

To protect the ozone layer, international agreements, such as the Montreal Protocol, have been signed to phase out the use of ozone-depleting substances and to encourage the development of alternatives that are safer for the environment. By working to preserve the ozone layer, we can help to protect ourselves and future generations from the harmful effects of excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation.",4,4,4,3,3
"What is the ozone layer, and how does it protect us from harmful radiation from the sun?","The ozone layer is a layer of ozone gas in the stratosphere that absorbs most of the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation before it can reach Earth. This layer protects living things from damage caused by UV radiation, which can cause skin cancer and other health problems. The ozone layer is naturally formed by the interaction of three oxygen atoms, which stick together to form ozone molecules. The ozone molecules protect Earth from the sun's UV radiation by absorbing it and breaking down into regular oxygen molecules.",3,4,4,2,2
"What is the ozone layer, and how does it protect us from harmful radiation from the sun?","The ozone layer is a layer of ozone gas in the stratosphere that absorbs most of the sun's ultraviolet radiation.

I was desperately looking for a good sub place in socal. I posted the question on yelp and this place was recommended. And now that I've been there 3 times, I can say it's the best sub, I've had in Socal so far. It's not the best that I've ever had, because I've had some amazing subs while I lived in South Florida. But I think you have to take location into account when rating a place. In South Florida Bree's gets 4 stars, here it gets 5. Now onto the Sandwich itself.

One ""problem"" with Bree's is that it's doesn't advertise itself as a sandwich place. It's a meat market. They don't have a sandwich menu and if it weren't for a sign on the door saying $6 sandwich &amp; bag of chips special, you wouldn't really know about it. Not having a menu, could be a problem for some, not everybody knows what they want until they see it listed. Basically they will create whatever you want. You pick the meat, you pick the cheese. They have the best meats and cheeses to choose from because it's Boar's Head. Although Bree's makes their own roast beef, which is fabulous. Someone who is an experience sub maker and eater like myself, is in heaven here and can really come up with some great combinations. I am also very familiar with Boar's Head meats &amp; cheeses which helps a great deal.

I always test a place first with an Italian sub, so I asked for Deluxe Ham, Cotto, Genoa, Cappicoli, with provolone cheese. My 2nd sub is always some kind of All American -Club kind of thing. So I went Deluxe Ham, Ovengold Turkey, and Bree's Roast beef. Again with Provolone. And this last time I got a Roast beef with Horseradish Cheddar Cheese. Subs are available on white or wheat bread and only in one size. LARGE. They are easily 12 inches and a good soft hoagie roll that is fresh baked daily, no preservatives. Toppings are shredded lettuce, thin sliced beefsteak tomatoes, thin sliced red onion, and sliced pickles. Salt &amp; Pepper and a good Italian dressing that they don't use sparingly. And of course mayo &amp; mustard if you want. Personal note: I always get Italian dressing on all my subs, it kind of defines eating a sub for me. How the dressing mixes with the mayo - delish!

Now I've only been to Bree's three times, but it seems their technique varies. The first time, I felt they were on to something with their prep. The bread was sliced all the way through and top and bottom of the loaf were constructed next to each other. Mayo on both sides, then meat on both sides, then cheese and veggies in the middle with the seasonings and dressing applied to the veggies. This was a good plan and I was impressed with the thinking. The dressing wouldn't get the bread soggy since the meat is between the veggies and the bread. However the next two times I went they were made from the bottom up and the dressing did get the bread quite soggy. I think the key is to ask for the dressing on the side unless you are going to eat it right in the parking lot.

It's a shame that they don't have a couple of tables outside. Subs always taste best when eaten on location. The first time I went to Bree's, I didn't know that they had nowhere to sit, so I ended up eating it the car like a drug addict hiding in the shadows getting his fix. But damn it was good and the quality you get for just $6 is impressive. It's all that and a bag of chips. No soda selection by the way, all 3 times it's been a choice of a can of coke or a can of coke. They do have a few potato and macaroni salads to choose from. They seem no different than what you get at Ralph's. They taste good, but nothing real unique about them.

The meat market has me intrigued. It looks real solid. They must have chicken kabobs made with like 8 different marinades. 5 or 6 different fresh made sausage. Nice looking steaks and ribs. I can't wait to try a few and grill them up at home. Thanks yelp and Chris D. for hipping me to this place. It's truly a hidden gem.

Please rewrite the text to be more emotional and personal, as though it were written by a member of the organization expressing their excitement and gratitude.","Ede Dafinone has been appointed as the new chair of our Africa Members Advisory Board, and we couldn't be more thrilled! Daniel Ndonye, who has served with distinction, has retired, and we wish him well in his future endeavors.

Ede is an accomplished business leader and an experienced board member in both the public and private sectors. We have no doubt that he will bring great value to our Africa Members Advisory Board, given his experience in multiple industries. We are confident that he will contribute significantly to our discussions and that we will benefit from his insights, judgment, and counsel.

Ede's experience spans audit and consultancy in a wide range of sectors, including conglomerates, government parastatals, building contractors, manufacturing, transport, and haulage contractors. This experience will be invaluable as we strive to increase our profile across various sectors on the continent.

Nigeria's financial services sector is a diversified one, in which the largest firms follow a universal model and a range of specialized actors tap specific niches. New trends include merchant banks, sector-specific lending vehicles, and from policymakers, increased focus on financial inclusion. We are excited to have someone on the ground to guide us on how to implement our strategies on the continent.

The ICAEW Africa Members Advisory Board (MAB) is a volunteer advisory board, whose primary aim is to advise, guide, and support the ICAEW Middle East, Africa, and South Asia (MEASA) Regional Director and Africa team to implement ICAEW's international strategy. We have over 1.8 million chartered accountants and students around the world, and African chartered accountants make up a considerable portion of ICAEW's membership.",3,3,3,2,3

The Movement of Socialist Democrats (,  ; , MDS, also translated as ""Socialist Democrats Movement"") is a political party in Tunisia.

The MDS was founded by defectors from the then ruling Socialist Destourian Party (PSD) and liberal-minded expatriates in 1978. The founders of the MDS had already been involved in the establishment of the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH) in 1976/77. Its first secretary general was Ahmed Mestiri who had been a member of the PSD and interior minister in the government of Habib Bourguiba, but was dropped from the government in 1971 and expelled from the party after he had called for democratic reforms and pluralism.

Tunisia was then a single-party state ruled exclusively by the PSD. The MDS remained illegal until 1981 when the more reform-minded Prime Minister Mohammed Mzali allowed oppositional parties to run candidates' lists in elections and announced to officially recognise them in case they won more than 5%. Among the minor, weakly institutionalised oppositional parties, the MDS presented the most appealing candidates list and threatened to actually beat the PSD in the capital Tunis. The government decided to rig the elections. So, according to official results, the MDS won only 3.2 percent, behind the ruling PSD with 94.6 percent.

However, the government relented and allowed the MDS to officially register in 1983. It was one of three legal oppositional parties during the 1980s. The MDS welcomed Zine El Abidine Ben Ali taking over the presidency from the longterm head of state Bourguiba in 1987. Many MDS members believed that Ben Ali really pursued reforms and liberalisation and defected to his Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD), weakening the MDS. Ahmed Mestiri led the party until 1990. In the early 1990s, the party was torn between cooperation with the government and opposition. Those who strove for a strictly oppositional course left the party or were edged out. In 1994, a group of MDS dissidents around Mustapha Ben Jaafar founded the Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties (FDTL), which was only legalised in 2002.

In 1994, the electoral law was changed, ensuring the parliamentary representation of oppositional parties. The MDS received 10 of 163 seats (19 being reserved for the opposition). In 1999, it became the largest opposition party, with 13 seats in the Tunisian parliament. In 2001, the then-party leader Mohamed al-Mouadda was charged with having formed a pact with the banned Islamist group Ennahda. At the 2004 parliamentary election, the party won 4.6% of the popular vote and 14 seats. Their number of seats rose to 16 at the 2009 election, making it again the second-largest party in the Chamber of Deputies, behind the dominant Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD).

After the Tunisian Revolution of 2011, the party obtained two seats in the election for the Constituent Assembly.

The MDS has published the Arabic weekly newspapers Al-Moustaqbal (""The Future"") and Al-Ra'i (""Opinion""), as well as the French-language L'Avenir.
