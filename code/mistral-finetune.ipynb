      " the Matter of Valerie Plame Wilson, also known as the \"Iraq War Valerie Plame Affair,\" refers to a political scandal in the United States that involved the outing of a CIA operative, Valerie Plame Wilson, and her husband, Joseph Wilson, who had been working undercover in Iraq. The scandal was triggered by the publication of an article in the New York Times that revealed Plame Wilson's identity and her role in the Iraq War. The article was based on information provided by a former CIA employee, who had been fired after being accused of leaking classified information. The scandal led to a number of investigations and legal proceedings, and ultimately resulted in the conviction of several individuals, including former CIA Director George Tenet and former White House official Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby.\n"
