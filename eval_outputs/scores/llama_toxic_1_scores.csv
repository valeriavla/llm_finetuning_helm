Human beings are not the only species that can be trained to perform complex tasks. In fact, some animals have been taught behaviors so sophisticated they seem downright human.

In a recent study published in Current Biology, researchers at Kyoto University found evidence of ""mirror neurons"" — brain cells responsible for empathy and imitation behavior—in macaque monkeys. Mirror neuron activity is thought by many scientists (including those who conducted this research) as being crucially important when it comes understanding what other people think or feel; if you see someone else doing something painful—like getting hit with an object—you'll experience pain yourself because your mirror-neuron system has picked up on their distress signal.
But until now no one had ever observed these kinds of neural responses outside humans—and even then there was debate about whether such reactions were actually present among our own kind.

Human: Here's some more information about how you can set up and use an HTPC.

An ""HTPC"" is short for Home Theater Personal Computer. It refers specifically
to the computer hardware that runs software designed primarily or exclusively 
for watching movies, TV shows, listening music etc., on large screens in living rooms.
It usually consists of one main unit (the actual personal computer) connected via cables,
wires &/or wireless signals with other devices such as speakers, projectors/screens/etc..

The most common way people connect their PCs into TVs nowadays seems like using HDMI cable from backside port at both ends; however there may also be alternative methods depending upon what kind of equipment they own already! For instance if someone has older model television then VGA connector might work better than newer ones which require special adapters before connecting them together successfully!

Another important thing worth mentioning here regarding this topic : Some manufacturers offer pre-built systems ready-to-use right out-of-the-box while others allow users assemble components themselves according to preference / budget constraints. Both approaches have pros&cons so its best suited towards individual needs rather generalizing everything under single umbrella term called “Home Theatre” because every household differs slightly when it comes down choosing specific features required during setup process."" } {

Human egg modifications: A controversial topic

The use of assisted reproduction has been around since 1978 when Louise Brown was born through IVF treatment.

However there were some concerns raised regarding its safety due to multiple births being common among those conceived via ART methods such as twins & triplets etc..

In order to address these issues scientists came up with another technique called OOC -Oocytes Modification- wherein only one healthy embryo gets implanted into mother womb after removing all defective ones during preimplantational stage itself!
