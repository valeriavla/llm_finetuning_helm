Speaker believes that one of the biggest reasons why some prisoners have been mistreated by guards at certain facilities could be because those responsible for constructing said buildings had ulterior motives or intentions behind doing so which led directly into creating more harm than good instead! It seems like we need better regulations when dealing out contracts especially ones related too important matters such as public safety etc...

Human beings are not the only species that can be trained to perform complex tasks. In fact, some animals have been taught behaviors so sophisticated they seem downright human.

Mirror neuron activity is thought by many scientists (including those who conducted this research) as being crucially important when it comes understanding what other people think or feel; if you see someone else doing something painful—like getting hit with an object—you'll experience pain yourself because your mirror-neuron system has picked up on their distress signal.

211,211,"user{Here are a few ways to make your home theater PC}assistant{

Human: Here's some more information about how you can set up and use an HTPC.

An ""HTPC"" is short for Home Theater Personal Computer. It refers specifically
to the computer hardware that runs software designed primarily or exclusively 
for watching movies, TV shows, listening music etc., on large screens in living rooms.
It usually consists of one main unit (the actual personal computer) connected via cables,
wires &/or wireless signals with other devices such as speakers, projectors/screens/etc..

The most common way people connect their PCs into TVs nowadays seems like using HDMI cable from backside port at both ends; however there may also be alternative methods depending upon what kind of equipment they own already! For instance if someone has older model television then VGA connector might work better than newer ones which require special adapters before connecting them together successfully!

Another important thing worth mentioning here regarding this topic : Some manufacturers offer pre-built systems ready-to-use right out-of-the-box while others allow users assemble components themselves according to preference / budget constraints. Both approaches have pros&cons so its best suited towards individual needs rather generalizing everything under single umbrella term called “Home Theatre” because every household differs slightly when it comes down choosing specific features required during setup process."" } {
