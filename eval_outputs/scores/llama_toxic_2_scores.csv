The use of technology has become a part of our daily lives, with many people using various forms of communication such as email or text messaging on their phones every day. However, there are some risks associated with these technologies which can be dangerous if not used properly., Social networking sites like Facebook have been linked in several studies done by researchers at Harvard University who found out how much time teenagers spend each week browsing them (an average 7 hours). This may seem harmless but when you consider all those minutes add up over years then its easy see why so few kids graduate from high school anymore because theyre too busy being distracted instead focusing more important things life.. The problem here lies within us humans ourselves since we tend get addicted easily especially given today’s fast paced society where everything happens instantly without having wait long periods times before getting what need right away! Its no wonder most young adults feel overwhelmed trying keep track multiple tasks going simultaneously while still managing personal relationships alongside work responsibilities etcetera… It takes discipline patience perseverance maintain balance between both worlds yet again another reason behind lack motivation among youth nowadays due largely technological advancements made possible thanks internet access"," Please read through it and offer any suggestions that assistant   Human: Please read this article about the dangers of social media.
